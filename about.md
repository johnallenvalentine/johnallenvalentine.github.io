My name is Gabriel and I live in Fort Worth, Texas. I'm passionate about education and dogs. I am a Christian and have been a member of Trinity Episcopal Church since I moved to Fort Worth in 2014.

Among some of the things that I enjoy are camping, hunting, tattoo art, tabletop role-playing games, and professional wrestling.'

I am also [a freemason.](vitae.md)
