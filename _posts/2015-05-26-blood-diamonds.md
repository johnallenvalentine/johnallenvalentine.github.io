We had scheduled the trade-off for an hour before sunset. I had wanted to meet in a cafe and make the exchange over coffee and hidden daggers as the scent of cardamom and saffron wafted around us. They had wanted to meet at their camp, a castle of tents and latrines. Neither of us budged for three days, battling it out over quiet phone calls, letting venom and disdain seep through the receivers. It was a begrudging, but mutual agreement. Two hours south of Samara, and that would be as far north as they'd go. That was far more than I would have liked to go, but as long as we had extra tanks of gas for the old Land Cruiser, we'd be able to make the seventeen-hour drive north in a day of shifts. 

Arriving early was a precaution that needed to be taken. They didn't value timeliness, but they sure valued respect. Not from them to you, of course. This was a one-way arrangement. Yulian and I had made the drive without any issues, mechanical or human, but unease had accompanied us the entire way, resting on our shoulders and whispering into our ears.

I had wanted morning. They'd wanted midnight. Looks like they were closer to getting their wish than I was. The hour preceding sunset had long gone and passed, and I had resorted to throwing on a sweatshirt once I realized that I'd been shivering. Yulian tried the radio for the third time, setting it down when he saw hi-beams in the distance. He grinned with nervous eyes and press-checked his pistol. Ready. I followed suit, praying that we'd not need them.

The tan Jeep pulled up, and a tall Mende man exited the driver's seat as his shorter companion jumped out from the passenger side. A second Jeep, this a dusty white, pulled up. Swarming out of the packed vehicle, they rushed to Tall Man's side and glared at us. 

I looked over at Yulian, then at Tall Man. "Do you have the rocks?"

He nodded. "Do you have the arms?"

I nodded. I pointed at the crate. "Right there, all you'd want for the price." Tall Man gestured towards the crate, asking to see the contents. I grabbed a key from my pocket and fiddled with the lock. Tossing the lid open, I reached into the crate and grabbed a rifle. "Here we are. The AK-104. It'll be a great replacement or addition to your arsenal. You're still using seven-point-six-two, right?" Tall Man stared at me, a cloud of indifference wafting across his face. I laid the rifle back into the crate. "Well, can I see the bag?"

Tall Man grinned for the first time that I'd seen him tonight. He reached his left hand out, a little velvet bag grasped by the strings dangling from his fingers. A loud *bang* rang through the air and my right foot exploded into a mess of meat and bone. I collapsed into a screaming pile as I saw the gun he'd pulled with his right hand. Tall Man's men raised their AKMs and opened fire on Yulian, shredding him. 

Tall Man laughed, his smile from ear to ear. I felt the muzzle of his handgun against my temple. He laughed again and the pressure disappeared. Eight shots rang out and he holstered the gun. The bag landed in the sand, a few inches from my face. Tall Man kicked me in the ribs, then jumped into his car. Both Jeeps were filled to capacity, and one of them, I realized, had the crate of rifles. 

I dragged myself over to Yulian and shook his arm. He was gone. I tried to stand up. Blood gushed from my mangled foot and I collapsed again. Wiping the tears from my eyes, I looked at the Land Cruiser. The tires had all been blown out and a puddle of gasoline dripped from the tank and the gas cans. I shivered. 

By car, Samara was two, maybe two and a half hours north. On foot, probably thirty-six hours. That would make Mheiriz, what, maybe twelve hours on foot? They might be able to take care of me at the mosque and I might only lose the foot. The better question, the one that ricocheted in my skull, was *how long would that take on hand and knee?* I was losing blood and there were only eight hours until daylight, maybe less now. I couldn't figure out how much time had passed. Before I died, whether of dehydration, or blood loss, or the gun on my hip, I needed to see what I was going to die for. I opened the bag and moonlight glittered back at me from deep within the little bag. 

Diamonds. Forty-six diamonds. Staring at them, my jaw dropped. They had given us the diamonds anyway. They didn't care in the least. Was this a game? It didn't matter. Anger pumped through me. 

Staring east, I began crawling towards Mheiriz, leaving a black, bloody stain on the sand wherever my foot dragged.
