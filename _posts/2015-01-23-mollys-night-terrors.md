"Daddy, I heard the noise again!" Molly exploded into my room during the ink-stained early morning. What time was it, one, two, three? The fog of sleep obscured my thoughts and blurred my vision. Cotton-brained and bleary-eyed, I sat up, fighting the gravity of Jupiter pulling me towards my mattress.
 
 "Come here, baby." I reached out and wrapped her in my arms. Her breath, rapid, warmed my ear, and the tears welling from her eyes began to collect on my beard. I hated the nightmares. Was it ever fair? Not only did they plague me as a child, but they had to come for my kid, too. Before Sarah had passed, we'd gone from doctor to doctor trying to see if there was a treatment, a therapy, a medication, anything, that could keep our daughter from her nightly terrors. Once Molly and I were on our own, I'd resigned myself to living as an agent of damage control instead. And it worked okay, I guess. Who needs sleep, anyway?
 
 As Molly had gotten older, the nightmares had become more and more scarce. However, they seemed to become more severe, although I was never sure if that was because we losing our desensitization, or if Molly's mind was making up for the infrequency somehow. As she trembled in my embrace, I could tell that this episode had been as bad, if not worse, than usual.
 
 "What happened this time?"
 
 "Mommy came back, and Daddy, she was so lonely!"
 
 I could feel my porcelain heart shattering. She had been doing so well, I had thought. She didn't need this. I didn't need this. *We* didn't need this. I pulled back from the hug so I could look into her eyes.
 
 "Molly, honey, Mommy is in heaven now. She doesn't have to come back, she can keep us company from there."
 
 "Mommy doesn't think so."
 
 I ratcheted my hug around her again, holding onto her for dear life, trying to squeeze the unkindness out of life. My own tears formed as I wished that the years would pass us by and that Molly would better understand someday.
 
 I wiped my eyes and poured myself out of the bed, Molly's hand in mine. The time had come to check her room for monsters, ghouls, and ghosts, then send her to sleep. I think that with any other child, I would have simply let her sleep in my bed, but Molly kicked, and rolled, and crawled. Insomnia took a distant second place to Molly's somnambulist martial arts.
 
 Molly lead the way, pulling at my wrist with determination. Gone was the whimpering, replaced with a grim frown that reminded me too much of her mother.
 
 "You have to talk to Mommy."
 
 "Honey, it doesn't work that way."
 
 Still she dragged me down the hall. We got to her bedroom door, the darkness spilling out from a crack. She swung the door open. With a sigh, I flipped the lightswitch.
 
 "Huh. Mommy's not here, Daddy."
 
 My eyes scanned the room. Nope. No ghosts, no mommies here. I grabbed Molly and hoisted her onto the bed, trying not to let the frustration and the lack of sleep show on my face. Grey hair was already starting to creep in at my temples.
 
 "Do you see? Mommy just has to watch from heaven, she doesn't have to come down."
 
 "She came down anyway."
 
 "Honey, please, please, please go to bed. I promise that everything is okay. We can talk in the morning when we eat before school, okay?"
 
 I reached to turn the light on her bedside table off. Right before I heard the switch *click* and the light went out, I caught a glimpse of something that should never have been there. I switched the light back on, but it was gone.
 
 "What's wrong, Daddy?"
 
 "Nothing, baby. Daddy just wanted to double-check for monsters. There aren't any. Good night"
 
 I was a hundred and ten percent certain that we had buried my wife with her wedding ring.
 
 Now, I'm not so sure.
