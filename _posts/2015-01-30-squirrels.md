I had never, ever seen a squirrel do *that* before. 

The Saturday morning hangover was receding, mental molasses trickling out of my skull and down my aching neck. Everyone has a ritual. I cook. A feast was piled on the patio table before me. A red solo cup hosted a Bloody Mary, made with tomato-infused vodka, freshly blended cherry tomatoes, no garnish, no ice, double Tabasco. The sound of the blender was cleansing. One French press of Costa Rican coffee. Two avocados, covered in faux-Cajun seasoning. *Heuvos Rancheros,* an explosion of eggs, Pace, ground beef, onions, garlic, and beans. Five strips of bacon, three cigarettes, and one *glorious* view of my overgrown backyard.

I lit the first cigarette and let my face hide from the world in the diminutive smoke cloud that the marriage of cigarette and lighter had birthed. A whispering breeze cleared my vision, and my half-dead stare across the brown grass caught a squirrel. We made eye contact, and for a short time, I was spellbound. The animal twitched, breaking my concentration, and I leaned back into my filthy lawn chair. *I could grab my pellet gun from indoors.* Tree rats were both irritating and delicious. 

I didn't get to the opportunity to go inside. The squirrel let out a shriek and charged with a ferocity that I have only ever seen in police dogs. With the seeming force of a small sun, it slammed into the brick siding of my house, not three feet from where I sat. The cigarette dropped from my mouth and the hot cherry singed my store-brand basketball shorts. In an instant, I felt very motivated, and slapped my lap like I was trying out for a position as a voodoo circle drummer. The cigarette flew across the patio and came to rest by the squirrel. I got up, stomped it out, then squatted down and examined the animal. Didn't look like it was breathing, so I poked it. *Nada.* It had broken its neck on impact, I supposed. I retrieved my drink and peered at the squirrel as I sipped out of the red cup. 

The grass where the squirrel had come from was still except for the spring breeze. *No more where that came from, I guess.* I stared at the dead tree beyond. Had the squirrel made a nest of sorts there, or was it from a different backyard? Imagining an animal *choosing* to live in this backyard gave me a chuckle. From the top of the tree, I heard the melody of birdsong. I thought that I'd heard all the the bird calls in this neighborhood, but this one seemed... different. There was a minor tonality to it, with half-steps and dissonance. The bird ramped up the volume, and hit a crescendo as its shadow crossed the grass and it hurtled through my patio, slamming into the wall right where the squirrel had.

At this point, all thoughts of the hangover had fled my mind. Running to the backyard, I whipped around, looking at the bushes, the sky, the trees, anything. The squirrel had strange, but this, this was something else. *Nothing.* What was I looking for, anyway? A UFO? An FBI van? I stopped, trying to breathe. My heart slowed from its frantic pace. *It's okay. I'm okay.* I turned back to the house. Breakfast was over, morning rituals be damned, I was done. I stared at the bird, lying in a crumpled mess next to the squirrel, then at the wall. One of the bricks seemed to glow and I could not take my gaze off it. The smell of the chalky brick clay filled my nostrils from twenty feet away, the taste of dirt filled my mouth. A human rhino, I lowered my head, and charged.

"Heeey there, brother!" White lights, beige walls. Vision blurry. Needle in arm. "You've had a bad concussion. Lay back. We need you to relax and take it easy. We're gonna gonna schedule an MRI real quick, so don't go anywhere."
