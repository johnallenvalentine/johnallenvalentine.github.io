title: Birthday Party
---

Today was going to be the perfect birthday for Adam, Christy was sure of it. The cake that she ordered had arrived the night before, pristine and beautiful. The balloons were inflated, friends invited, and she'd even hired a magician to show up later! No expense had been spared.
 
She walked into the garden, admiring the streamers that she had put up. The music was playing - loud enough to be heard, but quiet enough for the mothers to chat with each other. The other parents would be so jealous of the party she'd thrown together. Guilty pleasure tickled at her mind as she pictured Adam's friends begging their parents for a party like his.
 
The music playlist that she'd put together started winding down. Christy strode into the kitchen, and pulled the ice cream cake out of the freezer. Now was the time! She had put the candles in last night, so all she had to do was light them. The cake ablaze with ten candles like ten little lighthouses, she walked into the yard, singing the opening verse of "Happy Birthday."
 
 "Now, Adam, make a wish!"
 
Setting the cake down in front of her son, she waited with anticipation. What would he wish for? Would he wish for the present that she'd gotten him? If Adam didn't like the blue bike, she had purchased a red one as a backup gift. She waited for the candles to blow out. She waited for a long time, actually. As much as she would like, Adam's corpse was incapable of blowing out candles.
