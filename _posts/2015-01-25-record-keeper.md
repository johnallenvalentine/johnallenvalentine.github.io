I never claimed to be a wise man. Maybe that's what's kept me employed. Maybe that's what's going to get me fired. Not anything that I was thinking about in a frequent sort of way, especially on a Monday morning commute. 

He looked to be in his early twenties, if that. An itch in the back of my brain skittered around my skull when I saw him sitting in my chair. If it wasn't for the graphic print hoodie and the ripped jeans, he would have looked quite a lot like me when I first started, black/white Converse sneakers and chunky glasses askew. Of course, the computer wasn't there when I started. *I was, what, twenty one? Twenty two?* I had just gotten out of college, I remember that part well enough. Socrates himself held no candle to the ego my younger "college-educated" self.

The intrusion parked behind my desk didn't stir when I walked into the room. Absorbed in discovery, he admired the living relic that was my work computer and petted it like you would an old hound. You could see where his fingers had wiped the dust off the computer casing and I flushed red at my negligence. *How long had it been since I had cleaned that PC?* Lord knows. 

I rapped my fingers on the top of the CRT monitor, a militant drum tattoo startling the skinny spider of a kid from his absorption. He slammed backwards into the chair, legs flying akimbo, and the whole ensemble of kid and chair clattered to the ground. A groan emanated from behind the desk, obscured by the the paper fortress around my workspace.

"You gonna tell me who you are?" I asked. Not waiting for a response, I walked around the desk, picking up my chair, then helping him up as he tried to compose himself. After feeling his head for lumps, he asked,

"Are my pupils dilated? Slurring? Anything weird going on?"

"Well, if you're asking about concussions, you're probably fine, but in my opinion you were probably already plenty weird." His stare at the floor intensified at my remark. "Now, who are you?"

"Markus. I'm the new hire. I take it you're Ben?"

"You can call me Mr. Rhoads. What about it?" My suspicion prickled. *What did this kid want?*

"I was told you're training me. Abby mentioned some sort database. I think she thinks that's a good fit since I'm a comp-sci student." A flash of embarrassment blitzed across his face. "I'm not so sure if that's really what my major is for, but I'll try it."

*So that's it.* Abby is finally replacing me. A coolness flowed through my body and my mind slowed. *Well, at least my wife has a steady income.* I wasn't quite eligible for pension yet. Abby would know that. *What a shitty move on your part, Abby.*

What if I was just being paranoid? Abby had no cause to get rid of me, and the museum's cashflow had been running in the black. Of course, a cause could always be found, and this job didn't take two people to do.

It wasn't this kid's fault, though. I probably replaced someone else when I showed up to my own first day, but that was long ago enough that I don't remember if or who. My time would not be wasted hating this random kid.

"Welcome aboard, Markus. You ever used a computer this old before? Let me show you how."
