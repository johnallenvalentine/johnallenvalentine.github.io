The January snow crunched under Thomas' chilled feet. The church had been cold, the kind of cold that would creep into your lungs and sit there, waiting for the chance to kill you when it could. Outside wasn't much better. The wind blistered lips and wore down headstones like the vengeful scream of a banshee. At the very least, it wasn't too far from the church to the groundskeeper's cabin. There he'd be able to warm himself by the iron stove. When he'd built the cabin with his father, they'd made sure to make the stove the main fixture of the place. A big fancy desk was of no use to anyone if your fingers fell off from the winter's bite.
 
 As he reached the door of the cabin - well, shed, really - he turned to stare at the graveyard. He'd spent the last twelve years tending the church, its yard, and the graveyard. This place was more home than home itself at this point, with the serene expanse of the yard interrupted by flat marble slabs popping up like odd flowers. He turned back to the door, fumbling with his keys, when he heard a jingle that was too sonorous to be his keyring. Ice flowed through his veins and a glacial fear swept over him, crushing him, obliterating his comfort. 
 
 He stood, listening, every branch rustle, every snow fall, magnified to the crash and roar of a thousand cannons. He had known that sound. When he sniffled, the noise made him jump. He found himself staring at the field of graves, fixed in place. Empty. Nobody to be seen. His teeth chattered.
 
 *ring.*
 
 *ring-a-ding.*
 
 *ring.*
 
 He saw it this time. On the far end of the graveyard, where the newer graves were. Movement. Noisy movement. Thomas closed his eyes and prayed that he hadn't seen it move, but it had. The bell by the side of the headstone had jiggled back and forth. He threw the door to the cabin open, and grabbed his father's old shovel. The wood was dry, and the blade was rusted, but as long as Thomas had remembered, it had always been that way, so it stayed that way.
 
 *ring.*
 
 *ring-a-ding.*
 
 *ring.*
 
 He sprinted through the yard, legs pumping, feet thundering. He got to the grave where the bell had rung. The headstone proclaimed, "Elizabeth Jacobs" and the epitaph was obscured by the snowfall. 
 
 *ring.*
 
 *ring-a-ding.*
 
 *ring.*
 
 *They had buried her alive*, Thomas thought, *how many days had she been there?* Shivering from fear and cold, he threw himself at his work, planting the shovel into the frozen dirt and taking bites out of the earth like a starving man. He labored, and the bell rang. 
 
 When he finally heard the *THUNK* of his shovel blade hitting wood, the ringing ceased. He cleared the dirt off and opened the casket. Lonely bones stared up at him. He blinked, unable to find words, or thoughts. As he tried to move around the casket to inspect the remains, he felt his foot slip, and he slammed his head into the handle of the hinged lid, falling into the casket as it slammed shut. 
 
 When the sun came up, the dirt in the freshly filled grave had not yet begun to freeze, and someone had brought flowers. The melting snow sloughed off the headstone, which read "Elizabeth Jacobs, born July 12th of 1867, died Oct 22nd of 1871, Taken Before Her Time." Although the groundskeeper was nowhere to be found, the church and the graveyard stayed clean for long after, and a musical note would sometimes be heard late at night.
